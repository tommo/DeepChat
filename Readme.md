## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone this repository into your Sublime Text `Packages` directory.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deepseek-chat-sublime.git
   ```

   Alternatively, you can download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it into the `Packages` directory.

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python 3 installed. The extension uses the `urllib` and `json` libraries, which are part of Python's standard library.

3. **Configure API Key**:
   Open the `DeepChat.sublime-settings` file in Sublime Text and add your DeepSeek API key:

   ```json
   {
       "api_key": "your_api_key_here",
       "model": "deepseek-chat",
       "system_message": "You are a helpful assistant.",
       "max_tokens": 100,
       "temperature": 0.7,
       "stream": true
   }
   ```

   Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual API key.
